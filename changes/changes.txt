Website Re-tuning Plan : 

1. Optimize the entire website for mobile devices.
2. Move the footer into a separate file, so the footer, header, and navigation bar can be easily included across all pages.
3. Improve the contact page and add a consistent header and footer.
4. Add a form to the contact page.
5. Redesign and update the footer.
6. Connect the newsletter to the homepage.
7. Replace the service page with a "Partner With Us" page.

Pages to be developed from scratch:

* Terms of Service page
* Privacy Policy page
* City Manager page
* Partner With Us page
* List Your Spot page


For terms of service and Privacy Policy, I will provide the content later. 

Use quality images, provide enough space and stcrtured text alignment... Make the pages lenghthy with images and responsive animated.
